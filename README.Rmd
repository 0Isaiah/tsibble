## Overview

The **tsibble** package provides a data class of `tbl_ts` to manage temporal data frames in a tidy and modern way. A *tsibble* consists of a time index, keys and other measured variables in a data-centric format, which is built on top of the *tibble*.

## Installation

You could install the development version from Github using

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("earowang/tsibble", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Get started

### Coerce to a tsibble with `as_tsibble()`

The `weather` data included in the package `nycflights13` is used as an example to illustrate. The "index" variable refers to the `time_hour` containing the date-times, and the "key" is the `origin` as weather stations. **The key together with the index uniquely identifies each observation**, which defines a valid *tsibble*. Others can be considered as measured variables.

```{r nycflights13, message = FALSE}
library(tsibble)
weather_ts <- as_tsibble(nycflights13::weather, origin, index = time_hour)
weather_ts
```

The **key** is not constrained to a single variable, but expressive for nested and crossed data structures. See `?tsibble` and `vignette()` for details.

### Summarise over calendar periods with `tsummarise()`

The common *dplyr* verbs, such as `summarise()`, `mutate()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `arrange()`, work with the tsibble. We also have a new verb `tsummarise()` to aggregate interested variables over calendar periods.

```{r tsummarise}
weather_ts %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  tsummarise(
    year_month = yearmth(time_hour), # monthly aggregates
    avg_temp = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
    ttl_precip = sum(precip, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

The `tsummarise` goes hand in hand with the index functions including `as.Date()`, `yearmth()`, `yearqtr()`, `year()`, and other *lubridate* friends like `ceiling_date()`.
