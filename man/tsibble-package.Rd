\title{tsibble: temporal-context data frames and tools}
\description{
The \strong{tsibble} package provides a data class of \code{tbl_ts} to manage temporal
data frames in a tidy and modern way. A tsibble consists of a time index,
key(s) and other measured variables in a data-centric format, which is built on
top of the tibble.
}
\section{Index}{

The time indices are no longer an attribute (for example, the \code{tsp} attribute
in a \code{ts} object), but preserved as the essential component of the tsibble. A
few index class, such as \code{Date}, \code{POSIXt}, and \code{difftime}, forms the basis of
the tsibble, with new additions \link{yearmth} and \link{yearqtr} representing year-month
and year-quarter respectively.
}

\section{Key}{

Key variable(s) together with the index uniquely identifies each record. And
key(s) also imposes the structure on a tsibble to describe other measured
variables:
\itemize{
\item None: an implicit variable
\item A single variable: an explicit variable. For example, \code{data(pedestrian)}
uses the \code{Sensor} column as the key.
\item Nested variables: a nesting of one variable under another. For example,
\code{data(tourism)} contains two geographical locations: \code{Region} and \code{State}.
\code{Region} is the lower level than \code{State} in Australia; in other words, \code{Region}
is nested into \code{State}, which naturally forms a hierarchy. A vertical bars (|)
is used to describe this nesting relationship, and thus \code{Region} | \code{State}.
In theory, nesting can involve infinite levels, so is \code{tsibble}.
\item Crossed variables: a crossing of one variable with another. For example,
the geographical locations are crossed with the purpose of visiting (\code{Purpose})
in the \code{data(tourism)}. A comma (,) is used to indicate this crossing
relationship. Nested and crossed variables can be combined, such as \code{data(tourism)}.
}

These key variables are descriptors, not values.
}

\section{Print options}{

The tsibble package fully utilises the \code{print} method from the tibble. Please
refer to \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble::tibble-package} to change display options.
