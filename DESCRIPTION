Description: Provides a 'tbl_ts' class (the 'tsibble') to store
    and manage temporal data in a data-centric format, which is built on
    top of the 'tibble'. The 'tsibble' aims at easily manipulating and
    analysing temporal data, including counting and filling in time gaps,
    aggregate over calendar periods, performing rolling window
    calculations, and etc.
