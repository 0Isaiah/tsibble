If you're new to tsibble, a good place to start is my `rstudio::conf(2019L)` talk [[slides](https://slides.earo.me/rstudioconf19); [video](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/melt-the-clock-tidy-time-series-analysis)] featuring a full-circle analysis about energy consumption, from creating a tsibble to forecasting evaluation.

If you're interested in design philosophies underlying tsibble, this [preprint](https://pdf.earo.me/tsibble.pdf) describes them in depth, and my [JSM presentation](https://slides.earo.me/jsm19) gives a succinct summary.

If you'd like to learn more about forecasting tsibble, the online textbook [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https:://otexts.com/fpp3) provides great teaching and learning resources.
