The **tsibble** package expands [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) to temporal-context data. Built on top of the [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org), a tsibble (or `tbl_ts`) is a data-centric format, where time indices are preserved as the essential component and heterogeneous data structures are made possible. Beyond the tibble-like representation, a grammar is introduced to impose additional and informative structures on the tsibble, which is referred to as "key" variables. Multiple keys separated by a vertical bar (`|`) or a comma (`,`) are expressive of nested or crossed variables. This binds [hierarchical and grouped time series](http://pkg.earo.me/hts/) together into the tsibble framework. The tsibble aims at managing temporal data and getting analysis done in a tidy and modern manner.

```{r initial, echo = FALSE, cache = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = TRUE,
  fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6, fig.align = 'centre',
  comment = "#>"
)
options(tibble.print_min = 5)
```

The `as_tsibble()` is an S3 method to coerce other objects to a tsibble. An object that a vector/matrix underlies, such as `ts`, `mts`, or `hts`, can be automated to a tsibble using `as_tsibble()` without any specification. If it is a tibble or data frame, the `as_tsibble()` requires a little more setup in order to identify the index and key variables.

## Index and key(s)

```{r weather}
library(tsibble)
library(lubridate)
weather <- nycflights13::weather %>% 
  select(origin, time_hour, temp, humid, precip)
weather
```

The `weather` data included in the package `nycflights13` contains the hourly meteorological records (such as temperature, humid and precipitation) over the year of 2013 at three stations (i.e. JFK, LGA and EWR) in New York City. Since the `time_hour` is the only one column consisting of the timestamps, the `as_tsibble()` detects it as the index variable; alternatively, it is more verbose to specify the argument `index = time_hour`. A tsibble is comprised of an index and key variables. In this case, the `origin` variable forms the key, and the key should be passed to `...` in the `as_tsibble()`. Therefore, **the key together with the index uniquely identifies each observation**, which gives a valid tsibble.

```{r weather-ts}
weather_tsbl <- as_tsibble(weather, origin)
weather_tsbl
```

```{r flights}
flights <- nycflights13::flights %>%
  mutate(sched_date_time = time_hour + minutes(minute)) %>%
  select(
    flight, origin, dest, sched_date_time, 
    dep_delay, arr_delay, air_time, distance
  )
```

```{r flights-ts}
flights_tsbl <- flights %>%
  as_tsibble(flight, origin, dest, index = sched_date_time, regular = FALSE)
flights_tsbl
```

```{r tourism}
tourism <- as_tsibble(tourism, Region | State, Purpose, index = Quarter)
```
